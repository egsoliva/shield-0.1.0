# Graph Experiments
I'd like to share some graphs I've made while messing around with the accelerometer.

## Range: -/+16g @ 100 Hz
You can pretty much see how far the fluctuations are from each other and from their true values.
This was taken when the accelerometer was sitting still in a chair. Their acceleration values should be 0, 0, 9.81
in the x, y, and z axes respectively.
